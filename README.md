# [Earthquake]

Earthquake is a personal project that I decided to create to brush up on newer web technologies. I was inspired by the "Earthquake" exhibit at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, which included a live planetarium view of earthquake activity, from below the Earth's surface. I decided to use WebGL to create a similar view.

## Quick start

Choose one of the following options:

1. View the page at [http://mattbaker.me/earthquake](http://mattbaker.me/earthquake). This will show you all of the earthquakes measured in the past 24 hours by the USGS.
2. Use your mouse to move the camera around underneath the earth's crust (you can also use the "A" and "D" keys to rotate the camera if needed). Click on the quake markers to view depth and magnitude information.
